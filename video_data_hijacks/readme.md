This folder stores the hijacked video files. There will be a substructure of folders below. Each folder represents a game, the game name is hashed to guarantee that every single game can be correctly represented in a linux folder structure. 

Previously these folders were the plaintext name of the game, however due to some games this caused errors.

These folders will only temporarily hold the hijacked videos, after which they will be transfered to S3 and deleted.
