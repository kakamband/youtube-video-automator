You are moments from automating your first YouTube video!

Feel free to hop right in [https://twitchautomator.com/login], however, if you want a quick tutorial keep reading.

It's honestly as easy as 1, 2, 3.

1. Start The Clip Enter a Twitch link, and click 'Start Clip'.

That's it. Your video is on the first step to YouTube!

Save some time with step 2 by setting some default settings [https://twitchautomator.com/defaults].

Start Clipping Now [https://twitchautomator.com/dashboard] 2. End The Clip Leave the clip running as long as you want (however, clips are capped at 30 minutes).

Once you feel your video is done, click 'Stop Clip'. Wait usually 5 seconds and instantly view the clip.

If you have time, fill out any video information. Things such as: Video title, Description, Thumbnail, Playlist (etc).

Remember, most of the above settings can have default values [https://twitchautomator.com/defaults], meaning you don't always have to fill them out!

3. Fill out Required Info Some information (video title, and description) is required for us to upload a video on your behalf.

We will constantly update you if anything is preventing your clip from being uploaded.

If you set any default intros or outros, they will be automatically processed into the output YouTube video.

All other video information (tags, thumbnails, etc) will either be empty or the default values [https://twitchautomator.com/defaults] will be used.

Done. Soon your video will be available for all your fans!

Watch the notifications to see the video progress towards YouTube.

Find all the previous videos you uploaded, clips you can download, and more on the videos page [https://twitchautomator.com/videos].

Remember that you can also automate the creation of montages, just increase the minimum video length in your default settings and clips will automatically be combined to reach that length.
